# Fantasy-Football

This is going to be a working project around fantasy football using R. This will use NFL data from the `nflverse` library. The first step is to collect weekly and seasonal data and clean it for later use. This will be done for teams as a whole offensively and defensively, as well as individual players on offense. Once the data is collected, a shiny app will be built to explore player data. At the end we'll try building a few models to predict fantasy football points at a weekly level to compare to current predictions and see if there can be something more accurate to help with lineup decisions and draft strategies.
