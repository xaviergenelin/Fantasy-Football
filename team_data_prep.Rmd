title: "Team Data"
author: "Xavier Genelin"
---

This file will focus on getting team related data ready for use in the R Shiny application. The following libraries will be needed:
* tidyverse
* nflverse

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
library(tidyverse)
library(nflverse)
library(fst)
```

```{r seasons}
start_season <- 2015
end_season <- 2023
```


# Offense

This section will focus on offensive data for each team. One will be broken out into running plays and the other into passing plays. At the end, both will be combined to give one dataframe for team offensive data

```{r ids}
# load player ids with their position
ids <- load_players() %>%
  select(position, gsis_id)

ids
```

```{r}
teams <- load_teams()
teams
```

```{r participation}
# load participation stats for each play
participation <- load_participation(seasons = TRUE)

participation
```

```{r pbp}
# load in play by play data and only get regular season plays
pbp <- load_pbp(seasons = c(start_season:most_recent_season())) %>%
  filter(season_type == "REG") %>%
  # get the position of the passer
  left_join(ids, by = c("passer_player_id" = "gsis_id")) %>%
  rename(passer_position = position) %>%
  # get the position of the rusher
  left_join(ids, by = c("rusher_player_id" = "gsis_id")) %>%
  rename(rusher_position = position) %>%
  # get the position of the receiver
  left_join(ids, by = c("receiver_player_id" = "gsis_id")) %>%
  rename(receiver_position = position) %>%
  # add in additional play information
  left_join(participation, by = c("game_id" = "nflverse_game_id", "play_id" = "play_id"), suffix = c("", "_remove")) %>%
  select(-contains("_remove"))

pbp
```

## Offensive Rushing

```{r rushing}
# filter the play by play data to get just rushing plays
rushing <- pbp %>%
  # don't include 2 point conversions (that will be used later) or plays that are listed as a penalty
  filter(rush_attempt == 1 & play_type_nfl != "PAT2" & play_type_nfl != "PENALTY")

rushing
```

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
Get rushes inside the redzone, 10 yard line, 5 yard line and by position
